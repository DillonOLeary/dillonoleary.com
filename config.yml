          I worked on two teams at Amazon. I started on the ordering team, but soon I switched to sustainabilty. That was the start of my career shift towards work in climate tech. While I was at Amazon, I did the following:
          - Led a documentation restructuring initiative to improve usability of Amazon's complex platform, reducing on-call burden for platform engineers.
          - Designed and developed a Python-based tool for auditing AWS functions that calculate global carbon emissions, supporting Amazon's sustainability report.
