      I am a software engineer based in Seattle. Formerly a sustainability specialist at Amazon, I now work independently as a backend engineer in the civic and climate space.

      Relationship building is core to all my work. This means building trust through clear expectations and visibility with clients, setting office hours and leading one-on-ones with my team, and planning 60+ person org events at Amazon.

          I worked on two teams at Amazon. I started on the ordering team, then soon switched to sustainability. That was the start of my career shift towards work in climate tech.
          
          While I was at Amazon, I did the following:
          - Led a documentation restructuring initiative to improve the usability of Amazon's complex platform, reducing the on-call burden for platform engineers.
          - Designed and developed a Python-based tool for auditing AWS functions that calculate global carbon emissions, supporting Amazon's sustainability report.
