Hi!

I graduated from University of Wisconsin-Madison with a B.A. in Computer Science and a B.A. in Psychology in 2020. My core competencies are Python, Java, and AWS.

Before joining Climatebase, I worked as a Software Development Engineer at Amazon for two years, where I contributed to various projects related to sustainability and ordering. I created a system that allowed auditors to inspect how Amazon calculated its carbon footprint from buildings, leading design discussions and collaborating with other engineers. I also worked on the compute engine team that managed the backbone of ordering at Amazon, orchestrating the processing of a massive number of orders placed globally. I handled high severity issues, improved the development experience for plugin owners, and undertook a major overhaul of the documentation structure. I am passionate about creating scalable and reliable solutions that have a positive impact on the environment and society. I value learning from diverse perspectives and experiences, and I am eager to apply my skills and knowledge to the climate space.
