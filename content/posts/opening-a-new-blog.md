Is this personal website just supposed to be a resume? I hope not. But I guess if I link to it on my resume it kind of becomes one. It's certainly my public facing presentation of myself and I have to keep in mind that the audience is potentally much bigger than when I journal in my notebook.

Even with a bigger audience, I hate the idea of fitering who I am just to get a job. I think what I'll do is make the easiest-to-reach content on my website the resume stuff. But as you dive deeper into my website, especially the blog, you'll see my more raw and insecure thoughts. I figure if any hiring manager wants to dig that hard then they should be open to the idea that I have some nuance and depth as a human.
