#### Friendly Software Engineer Dedicated to Social Benefit

I wanted to do a deep dive into what I mean when I title myself that way. Each of those words was carefully chosen, so buckle up because the semantics train is leaving the station toot toot!

## Friendly

I'm not just throwing this on there casually, community and friendship are a core piece of what brings me joy in life, as well as a skill that sets me apart from a lot of other people. I think it's an undervalued skill in tech, but a feeling of community is critical to what makes a team function well.

Ok, and I'll admit it's a little cute too. Makes me sound like Spider-Man.

## Software Engineer

I've spent a while reflecting on how to label my skillset. Computer scientist? Programmer? Technologist? But software engineering fits best, and that didn't click for me until I read the book _The Missing README_ (TODO add hugo-cite), which created a clear structure to that set of skills I had been developing at Amazon. Software engineering is applying computer science to the delivery of software applications. It's the whole field of study layered on top of computer science. Good software engineering is "friendly", so for me "Friendly Software Engineer" is redundant, but not everyone sees it the same way so I left it in to emphasize that.

I excel at listening and customer service, so I may eventually pivot into more of a business role, like a product manager, but at the same time, I love coding so software engineering fits me best.

## Dedicated to Social Benefit

We'll start with social benefit, then talk about my relationship to it.

### Social Benefit

Social benefit is the broadest part of my title, but that broadness reflects the stage of my career that I'm in. I care deeply about doing good through my work and the people who benefit from that. The form this takes will likely shift throughout my career, but that mission never will. Constantly reflecting on the question of what is "good" and how that relates to what brings me joy has defined my career and I am confident it will for the rest of my life.

I've had many role models in my life who have made social good the goal of their career. Many members of my family are in medicine, psychology, and public health, my grandfather worked in civil engineering, my father works in journalism and education. Each of those is a form of social good and I'm sure that each of those people has reflected on these questions in their own way. I'm following in their footsteps and offering my joy of coding and helping others.

I'm avoiding using the phrase "dedicated to making the world a better place" or the word "good" because community, at different scopes, is central to who I am.

Maybe a less flattering way to describe me is "Hopelessly introspective people pleaser who likes coding, but also art, design and music but those aren't as marketable unless I go back to school for urban planning then maybe but I'm not sure I should do that"

TODO do I want to say public service? What about sustainability? What about community service? What about community building? I think "social benefit" is best. I care about strengthening communities to helping humanity at a larger scale.
