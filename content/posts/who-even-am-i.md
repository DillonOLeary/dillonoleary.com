#### Friendly Software Engineer Dedicated to Social Good

I wanted to do a deep dive into what I mean when I title myself that way. Each of those words was carefully chosen, so buckle up because the semantics train is leaving the station toot toot!

## Friendly

I'm not just throwing this on there casually, community and friendship are a core piece of what brings me joy in life as well as a skill that sets me apart from a lot of other people. I think sociability is an undervalued skill in tech and that creating a feeling of community is critical to what makes a team function well.

Ok, and I'll admit it's a little cute too.

## Software Engineer

I've spent a while reflecting on how to label my skillset. Computer scientist? Programmer? Technologist? But software engineering fits best, and that didn't click for me until I read the book _The Missing README_, which created a clear structure to that set of skills I had been developing at Amazon. Software engineering is applying computer science to the delivery of software applications. It's the whole field of study layered on top of computer science.

I excel at listening and customer service, so I may eventually explore more of a business role, like a product manager, but at the same time, I love coding so software engineering fits me best.

## Dedicated to Social Good

Social good is the broadest part of my title, but that broadness reflects the current stage of my career. I care deeply about doing good through my work and the people who benefit from that. The form this takes will likely shift in the future, but my dedication to reflecting on the question of what is "good" and how that relates to what brings me joy has defined my career and I am confident it will for the rest of my life.

I've had many role models in my life who have made social good the goal of their career. I have relatives who work in fields such as public health, psychology, education, journalism, and civil engineering. Each of those is a form of social good and I know that each of those people has reflected on these questions in their own way. I'm following in their footsteps while offering my joy of coding and helping others.

While protecting wildlife or creating a work of art could be good depending on your value system, my focus is human societies. Lately, I've been influenced by John Rawls' "original position" thought experiment. In this experiment, Rawls asks us to imagine that a "veil of ignorance" prevents us from knowing who we are in society: our economic situation, our race, our skills, etc. Then, we can make policy decisions with the idea that once the veil is lifted we could become any member of the society behind the curtain. Rawls believed this would lead to liberty and equal opportunity. I like it because it feels like a society-level extrapolation of the Golden Rule "Do unto others as you would have them do unto you", and I would add to it by considering future generations as well. Although the "veil of ignorance feels a bit too self-centered, it's still useful for encouraging empathy.

The "veil of ignorance" thought experiment has a more important issue beyond being self-centered - engagement, or the 'ivory tower-ness' of it. Engagement with social issues has been a focus of mine for years now and I think that emphasizes my privileged position in society. I'm white, male, and come from an upper-middle class house. I have the privilege to step outside myself and ask "What is worth working on?" rather than saying "We need to solve this immediate problem facing my family and my community" or even worse "Can I afford food this month?". This is where perfect becomes the enemy of good. While I will never settle on an answer to "what is good", I do know that the unhoused people living down the street from me are struggling with food insecurity and safety, that a broken healthcare system in the US is making access to healthcare unreachable and too expensive for many, and that excess carbon is rising temperatures and the people who are the least responsible are facing the worst consequences. I'll likely write more about goodness, stay tuned for a blog examining sustainability, but while I reflect on that I'll continue to engage with evident social issues that at least push the needle toward a more just, good society.

And that's me. At least part of me. I also like going for runs and playing video games, but those aren't as marketable.
