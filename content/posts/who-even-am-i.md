#### A Friendly Software Engineer Dedicated to Public Service

I wanted to do a deep dive into what I mean when I title myself that way. Each of those words was carefully chosen, so buckle up because the semantics train is leaving the station toot toot!

## A

It's just an article. I guess it means that I'm a non-specific engineer, but let's back up before we get lost in an existential crisis.

## Friendly

I'm not just throwing this on there casually, community and friendship are a core piece of what brings me joy in life, as well as a skill that sets me apart from a lot of other people. I think it's an undervalued skill in tech, but a feeling of community is critical to what makes a team function well.

Ok, and I'll admit it's a little cute too. Makes me sound like Spider-Man.

## Software Engineer

I've spent a while reflecting on how to label my skillset. Computer scientist? Programmer? Technologist? But software engineering fits best, and that didn't click for me until I read the book _The Missing README_ (TODO add hugo-cite), which created a clear structure to that set of skills I had been developing at Amazon. Software engineering is applying computer science to the delivery of software applications. It's the whole field of study layered on top of computer science. Good software engineering is "friendly", so for me "Friendly Software Engineer" is redundant, but not everyone sees it the same way so I left it in to emphasize that.

I excel at listening and customer service, so I may eventually pivot into more of a business role, like a product manager, but at the same time, I love coding so software engineering fits me best.

## Dedicated to Public Service

We'll start with public service, then talk about my relationship to it.

### Public Service

This is the broadest part of my title. Sure, public service jobs are

TODO do I want to say public service? What about sustainability? What about community service? What about community building?
